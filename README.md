# DAG-simulator
Implementing a DAG and its simulation using greedy algorithm

The code asks the user for the number of nodes and the number of servers. The user is then asked to enter details of each node's arrival time, its parent nodes if any and its cloud server processing times with respect to te cloud servers available. Thus a design of the DAG is implemented.

Further the DAG is then simulated using the cloud servers available using greedy algorithm technique. The code prints the time at which a task is completed and the cloud server that it used. Finally, the optimal time using greedy algorithm is displayed, as well as the cost of the result (time taken by the local server to process the simulation).
